tinyRadioNetwork
----------------

It's a project of draft to define a node routing protocol for little 
wireless network (with radio chip like nRF24L01).

Every frame must be tiny 8 bytes max wide (for improve reliability). Network 
physical layer support broadcast (to radio neighborhood) and unicast transport.

Every node have an unique address on 1 byte first 4 bits are "net address", 
other 4 bits are "node id".

Nodes
-----

Network containt 2 type of node :
- Gateway (with node id = 0).
- Satellite (whith node id between 1 and 15).

Sample : 
* address 0x60, net is 0x6 and node is 0x0: it's the gateway for net id 0x6.
* address Ox46, net is 0x4 and node is 0x6: it's the Ox6 satellite in net id 0x4.

Note :
- Net ID 0 is reserved for future use.

Routing table
-------------

Every Gateway have a routing table in memory :

This table containt a metric for every net ID and the next hop to use in 
neighborhood

Example :
net ID / metric / next hop
   1       1        0x50
   2       3        0x50

Frame dictionary
----------------
   
Hello frame (send by every node at regular interval) :
                                      <-                         6 bytes (6 nodes)                                ->
<--- 1 byte ---> | <--- 1 byte ---> | <-4 bits-><-4 bits-> | <- ... -> | <-4 bits-><-4 bits-> | <-4 bits-><-4 bits-> | 
  frame type (0)  who am i (node ID)    net id    metric        ...        net id    metric       net id    metric

Frame for transmit 32 bits vars :

<--- 1 byte ---> | <--- 1 byte ---> | <--- 1 byte ---> | <-4 bits-><-4 bits-> | <-- 4 bytes --> |
  frame type (1)      to node ID        from node ID         ttl     var ID        32 bit var
